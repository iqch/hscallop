= Scallop point generator =

This is Scallop SOP - node, which generate pointsets of non-linear concurrent strange attrctors pool. More information about thme placed at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_flame Wikipedia article]


= Details =

SOP Node produced next data :
  * Raw poinsets, which may be reused as geometric quantity
  * Baked point sets, spooled to file
  * Division map, stored as bgeo, for reusing it at slicing
  * Division Atlas for custom executable, which can not use bgeo-based division maps
